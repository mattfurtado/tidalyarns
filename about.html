I had been knitting since childhood and became fascinated with the process of creating my own yarn.	<br /><br />During my years in Maine I learned the basics of spinning wool, spending lots of time with other spinners and enjoying the many beautiful fibers I collected at festivals throughout the State.	<br /><br />Over the past 20 years I have had the opportunity to work on two different sheep farms and learn through hands on experience what it takes to produce high quality raw wool. The knowledge I have gained, and continue to gain, about the raw wool itself has become a passion of mine.	<br /><br />As a long time supporter of locally grown organic foods, I am naturally drawn to finding the colors and pigments hidden inside local plants. The secrets come out in a process of chopping, soaking and heating the dye stuffs. There are now ancient natural dyes available through sources that are self-sustaining. They open up new color worlds and combined with the local dyes create a luscious color spectrum full of surprises and infinte possibilities of color combinations.	<br /><br />	Most of the fleeces I select are washed and spun at small, independent New England mills.  I feel very strongly about supporting small farms and businesses to help preserve the local natural resources involved in creating beautiful yarns.	</p>		<div id="photo">	Photo Gallery	<br />		<a href="images/picture01.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics]"><img src="images/thumbs/thumb1.jpg" alt="thumb1" /></a>		<a href="images/picture894.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics]"><img src="images/picture894.jpg" alt="thumb1" height="30" /></a>		<a href="images/picture23.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics]"><img src="images/thumbs/thumb23.jpg" alt="thumb23" /></a>		<a href="images/picture845.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics]"><img src="images/picture845.jpg" alt="thumb1" height="30" /></a>		<a href="images/picture897.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics]"><img src="images/picture897.jpg" alt="thumb1" height="30" /></a>		<a href="images/picture831.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics]"><img src="images/picture831.jpg" alt="thumb1" height="30" /></a>		<a href="images/picture538.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics]"><img src="images/picture538.jpg" alt="thumb1" height="30" /></a>		<!-- <a href="images/picture24.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics]"><img src="images/thumbs/thumb24.jpg" alt="thumb24" /></a>				<a href="images/picture25.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics]"><img src="images/thumbs/thumb25.jpg" alt="thumb25" /></a>				<a href="images/picture09.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics]"><img src="images/thumbs/thumb9.jpg" alt="thumb9" /></a>		        <a href="images/picture26.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics]"><img src="images/thumbs/thumb26.jpg" alt="thumb26" /></a>				<a href="images/picture27.jpg" rel="lightbox[pics]"><img src="images/thumbs/thumb27.jpg" alt="thumb27" /></a> -->	</div>	</td>	</tr>	</table></div><div id="footer">	<div class="bl"><div class="br">		Copyright &copy; 2007 Tidal Yarns	</div></div></div></div><script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">_uacct = "UA-3598795-2";urchinTracker();</script></body></html>
